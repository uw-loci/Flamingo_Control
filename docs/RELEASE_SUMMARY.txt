Refactor polish for viewer modularity & parity:
- Keep Napari as an addâ€‘on: new dockable `NapariFlamingoGui` with viewer widget.
- Unify queues/events via legacy adapter; remove duplicate globals.
- Fix imports and typos; correct entry points.
- Maintains external compatibility and prepares for alternate viewers.
